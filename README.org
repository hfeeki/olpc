* Overview

Just some simple instructions for running the emulator for the OLPC
project on Debian.

See the wiki at
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Emulating_the_XO/Quick_Start/ for other OSes
and distributions, although I've tried to make it even easier, and
give you a little folder to put stuff in and give you the script for
Debian.

* Installing and running the emulator

Simply =git clone= this repository and run the script with the
following line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~ && git clone git://github.com/zeller/olpc.git && cd olpc && ./qemu-olpc-debian.sh
#+END_SRC

This seems to require about 300MB of free space.
